    <h2>What is CMCS?</h2>
    <p>
        The Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) is designed to streamline the process of submitting
        and approving monthly claims for Independent Contractor (IC) lecturers. This system integrates
        functionalities that make it easier for lecturers to submit claims, attach documents, and ensure
        that all records are accurate and complete.
